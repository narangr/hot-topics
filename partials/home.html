        <p class="article-float">Money is a medium of exchange that facilitates trade in goods and services. From centuries “money” has always found its place in civilizations all over the world, in hugely similar and different forms. Wherever people pro¬gressed beyond simple barter, they began to use their most market¬able goods as a medium for exchange. In primitive societies, they used cattle, or measures of grain, salt, or fish. In early civilizations where the division of labour extended to larger areas, gold or silver emerged as the most marketable good and finally as the only medi¬um of exchange, called money. It is obvious that the leaders of the world did not invent the use of money. But they frequently usurped control over it whenever they suffered budget deficits and could gain revenue from currency debasement. When an economic good is sought and wanted, not only for its use in consumption or production but also for purposes of exchange, to be held in reserve for later ex¬changes, the demand for it obvi¬ously increases. People seek money because it has purchasing power, and part of this purchasing power is gen¬erated by the people’s demand for money.<a href="https://fee.org/articles/the-value-of-money/,  https://www.thoughtco.com/why-paper-momey-has-value-1146309" target="_blank">(The Source)</a></p>

        <p class="article-float">Looking at the present scenario 100 years from now:<br> 1)Global warming will increase which will eventually increase the earth’s temperature.<br> 2)There will be less trees compared to today as people plant less and cut more trees for industrialization and in the name of development.<br>3) There will be water shortage. Reports suggest that we will face a water crisis by the end of 2050.<br>4) There will be more frequent earthquakes and natural calamities as earth will reach its saturation point, above which it cannot handle things.<br> 5)  The population of the world will increase by 2050. So,It's high time now and we need to look at these aspects to save our earth and to present the earth to our young ones like we were given. <a href="" target="_blank">(The Source)</a></p>

        <p class="article-float">GMO foods are genetically modified foods, also known as genetically engineered food. These foods are produced from organisms that have been introduced into their DNA using the method of genetic engineering. It benefits the farmers as it increases crop yield, resistance to insects and tolerance for heat, cold, or drought. Along with some benefits, it carries some disadvantages like toxicity, inherently insatiable, can cause allergic reaction, can suppress the immune system & further more. Now you will be wondering how GMO work in food? So, genetic modification allows just one individual gene or a small number of genes, to be inserted into plants or animals. This enables them to be used in new & very precise ways. Compiling all pros & cons, we can conclude that GMO foods are helpful to human beings but should be used upto a certain extent. Also, GM food helps us to find sustainable ways to feed people. In countries that lack access to nutrient-rich foods, GMO foods are really helpful. The crops have longer shelf life that allow them to be shipped to remote areas.<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gmos-pros-and-cons#pros" target="_blank">(The source)</a></p>
